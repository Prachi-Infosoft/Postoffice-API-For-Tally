# Postoffice-API-For-Tally
This is an exe file which will take PIN Code as parameter and download Post offices of that PIN  in json and xml also with postoffice.xml and postoffice.json respectively.
So that earlier tally version (TallyERP-9) can use this if json support is not available user can use xml also.
